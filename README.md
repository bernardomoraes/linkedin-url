# How to Prepare Your Enviroment

## Install Packeges

Commands:
First of all, be sure you have the npm and node installed on your enviroment.

1. npm i puppeteer or "yarn add puppeteer"

Note: When you install Puppeteer, it downloads a recent version of Chromium (~170MB Mac, ~282MB Linux, ~280MB Win) that is guaranteed to work with the API. To skip the download, or to download a different browser, see the documentation.

2. npm install googleapis@39 --save

## Final Adjustments

### Find the path of Chromium on your computer and change the path in the code.

### Get the file of Keys from Googles Sheets API (or ask me)

### Change de Range as you wish
